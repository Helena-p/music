      content="Kyoto, Japan can be one of the most beautiful places to visit on a honeymoon or a family vacation. Kyoto is one of Japan’s largest cities which happens to be located on the Kamo River. Kyoto, Japan is a beautiful place where Blossom Trees bloom and beautiful sights are seen. The blossom trees here are very special, they are only in season for two to three days before all of the petals fall off in a big wave of pink. When this happens, it almost looks like the floors are made of pedals because of the overwhelming amount of blossoms on the ground. Regardless Kyoto has many places to explore and foods to eat."
